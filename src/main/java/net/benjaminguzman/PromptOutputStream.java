/**
 * This class provided very similar functionality to {@link OutputStream}, the only differences is that you can
 * configure it to print a prompt after any new line is printed.
 * <p>
 * You can also print an icon/emoji to indicate the status of the application.
 * This may improve user experience
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be used inside an application with interactive user input.
 * <p>
 * To use it, simply do something like this: {@code
 * PromptOutputStream pos = new PromptOutputStream(System.out);
 * System.setOut(new PrintStream(pos, true));
 * }
 * <p>
 * Note that, in this example the {@link PrintStream} we create contains a {@link PromptOutputStream} which contains
 * another {@link PrintStream} (because {@link System#out} is a {@link PrintStream}).
 * <p>
 * Even though this is not strictly bad, it may be cleaner to just extend {@link PrintStream}, but more code should
 * be written. Despite that, this may be a more general solution.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Even though some implementations of {@link OutputStream} or child classes (like {@link java.io.BufferedOutputStream})
 * are synchronized, this needs extra synchronization because this class has specific methods like
 * {@link #printPrompt()}
